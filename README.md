Build and deploy a custom object detection model with TensorFlow Lite (Android)
Object detection is a set of computer vision tasks that can detect and locate objects in a digital image. Given an image or a video stream, an object detection model can identify which of a known set of objects might be present, and provide information about their positions within the image.

TensorFlow provides pre-trained, mobile optimized models that can detect common objects, such as cars, oranges, etc. You can integrate these pre-trained models in your mobile app with just a few lines of code. However, you may want or need to detect objects in more distinctive or offbeat categories. That requires collecting your own training images, then training and deploying your own object detection model.
Here is an example of an output of the drawDetectionResult utility method.
